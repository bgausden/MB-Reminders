<p>We have given due consideration to the changing situation and the Hong Kong Government's latest guidelines to control the virus spread within Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see the following changes in the salon:</p>
<p>* Food and beverages will no longer be served in the salon. We also ask that clients do not bring anything for consumption to the salon.</p>
<p>* We will no longer make magazines available. E-Readers will instead be offered.</p>
<p>* We will no longer be recording client's temperature details at reception but we will be asking for clients to take their own temperature on entry to the salon</p>
<p>* Only clients receiving services or their guardians will be permitted to remain in the salon.</p>
<p>* Face shields will be available to clients. Masks will continue to remain on at all times.</p>
<p>* Staff will be wearing additional PPE. The quality of service will however be unaffected.</p>
<p>* Payment will be taken at the workstations. We will no longer be accepting cash for payments.</p>
<p>* We will be reducing the peak capacity of the salon to improve distancing.</p>
<p>* We will be introducing screens to further limit contact.</p>
<p>* Workstations will be disinfected between clients. This may occasionally introduce minor delays to the start of your appointment.</p>
<p>* Workstations will have antiseptic misters/filters installed. If you have any pre-existing conditions that may be triggered by antiseptic aerosols, please let us know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we respectfully request that, if you have recently arrived in Hong Kong, have recently had a positive COVID-19 infection, exhibit *any* cold or flu symptoms, that you let us know prior to arriving at the salon so we may make a determination on whether it is appropriate to delay the appointment. This request also applies to any members of your family or friends with whom you share a household or who may be accompanying you to the appointment.</p>
<p>For your convenience, a calendar attachment is included in this email.</p>
